# Media Hub

[Media Hub]([www.Robertaron.io/MediaHub](http://www.robertaron.io/MediaHub/#/)) is an app for uploading and download files. When the files are media based (file or video) you will be able to view the files in your browser.

This repo contains the code for the entire application.

## Going forward with the app

Overall fairly happy with the product considering it was built over the course of a week. Given another week here are the main two things I'd like to work on

- UI design. It works well functionally, but could use more flare ðŸŽ‰
- Upload Limit Increase. 6mb is fairly small. Currently this is a limit with AWS Lambda. In order to fix this I would spend a bit of time converting the API to use a more robust server.
